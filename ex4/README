Feel free to provide us with lukewarm feedback and exotic jokes.

Design:
=========================
      Architecture 
=========================

In our architecture we provided supreme modularity by breaking up the 
cache to the crucial components. The block is the basic uint emulating 
the OS block but containing additional features for our code. On top of that,
we alligned the memory allocations to simulae a real cache an reduce 
the overhead. The next layer is the block stack object which implements our 
stack of blocks with support to the various replacement algorithms.
The cache library is the final layer that provides the user with basic support 
for cache operations. Our code is extensive and provides support for edge cases 
and is proof from memory leakages. 
In addition, we have to maps in order to manage the open files properly.
